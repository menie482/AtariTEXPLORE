TODO NEXT TIME:
    MANUALLY DISCRETIZE STATE SPACE
    VERIFY ALGORITHM
    DONT LEARN ON RADAR JUMPS
    COPY CONSTRUCTOR FOR CONSTANT RETURNS THIS
    Maybe add indicator feature for pos/neg x-vel and pos/neg y-vel
    How is planner getting the feature sizes of its dependencies?


todo:
	Alter visual processing framework to do better self-tracking
		don't remove self object if its not moving
		maybe use a particle filter updated by current model?
	Edit TEXPLORE:
		Pass split structure through modelSpecs (which features in the model to have absolute vs relative splits, suggested values for those splits...)
		Detect whether or not to pass certain training experiences to certain features
		Print decision trees to see what's going on
		Improve fault tolerance and sensor delay, reject certain samples that aren't of some threshold of consistency?
		Don't recreate trees on missed prediction
		Suggest certain splits for decision tree (on variable values)
	State space:
		Think of a way to make this adapt better to decision tree framework
		Add nearest n object radar (or other type if we think of that first)
		Add map # feature
		Frames since start
		Discretize x,y coordinates?

	no GUI on submit to condor
