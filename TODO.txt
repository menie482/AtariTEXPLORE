todo:
	Alter visual processing framework to do better self-tracking
		don't remove self object if its not moving
		maybe use a particle filter updated by current model?
	Edit TEXPLORE:
        Think of a way to pass dependency structure (Type of model, Feature Dependencies, Which features kept steady for
        prediction, which features to have absolute vs relative splits, suggested values for those splits...)
		Detect whether or not to pass certain training experiences to certain features
        Print decision trees to see what's going on
		Improve fault tolerance and sensor delay, reject certain samples that aren't of some threshold of consistency
		Don't recreate trees on missed prediction
		Certain trees update on absolute states, some on relative changes
		Suggest certain splits for decision tree (on variable values)
	State space:
		Add nearest n object radar (or other type if we think of that first)
		Add map # feature
		Frames since start
		Discretize x,y coordinates?

	no GUI on submit to condor
