./experiment --agent texplore --rom ./games/asterix.bin

todo:
	Alter visual processing framework to do better self-tracking
		don't remove self object if its not moving
		maybe use a particle filter updated by current model?
	Edit TEXPLORE:
		Specify whether or not to do prediction on certain features or keep them steady
		Print decision trees to see what's going on
		figure out what first_action is doing and see if it's what we want to do on state space jumps
		Improve fault tolerance and sensor delay, reject certain samples that aren't of some threshold of consistency
		Don't recreate trees on missed prediction
		Certain trees update on absolute states, some on relative changes
		Suggest certain splits for decision tree (on variable values)
	State space:
		Add nearest n object radar (or other type if we think of that first)
		Add map # feature
		Frames since start
		Discretize x,y coordinates?

	no GUI on submit to condor
