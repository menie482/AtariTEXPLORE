Matt:

Todd:
    So far I've changed:
        Environment
        FactoredModel (in two places)
        What do I need to change in ParallelETUCT?
        Are there any complications with feature sizes?
            Shouldn't be anything involving the model and couldn't find anything in the planner that would suggest
            dependency structure required
